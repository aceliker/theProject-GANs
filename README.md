# theProject-GANs
Comp541-Deep Learning- Replica of the Work of Karras et al.

The project aims to replicate the results in the paper "Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation" by Karras et al. We will begin with low-resolution images and add new layers to the network so that the resolution will be a little bit higher in each layer added. The generator and the discriminator will be in progress simultanously in order for imrpoved resolutions and less training time while generation of images. Also minibatch standart deviation will be used to increase variation. As well as mimicing the code of the authors, we will use the same datasets used in the paper, Cifar-10 and CelebA (and CelebA-hq).
